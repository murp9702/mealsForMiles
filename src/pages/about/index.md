# We Fuel Adventures.

When my husband and I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2015, we made our own custom freeze-dried meals. Flavor, price, and nutrition were aspects of our backpacking meals that we were not willing to sacrifice. After hours of pouring over recipe books and scouring the internet, we settled on 8 nutritious meals for our journey. 

But having custom, nutritious meals for every journey should be easier... and that is how Meal to Miles was born!

Meals to Miles specializes in creating personalized meals tailored to each adventurer's allergies, food sensitivities, and food preferences. We offer a variety of services to meet every budget- anywhere from tailor making all meals for you or providing you with the kit to assemble them yourself. 

Our commitment is to provide you with the nutrition you need to keep exploring, all while taking care of your most important piece of gear, your body! 

We look forward to fueling your next adventure!
